-Mail is a Single Page App built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API applications and for backend used Django framework for server, SQLite as database and Django models, migrations to manage the database.. Here I put JavaScript skills to the test by manipulating and creating elements of the DOM.

-Used Markdown for creating and editing entries which is converted to HTML before displaying to the user.
